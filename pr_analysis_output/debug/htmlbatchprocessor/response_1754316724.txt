I've created a comprehensive interactive HTML dashboard for your PR analysis results. The dashboard includes:

## âœ¨ Features Implemented

**Dark Theme**: Uses your exact color scheme (#0f0f23 background with light text)

**Executive Summary Section**:
- Shows the correct counts: Ready (198), Conditional (18), Not Ready (29)
- Total of 245 files analyzed
- Visual progress bar showing 80.8% merge readiness

**Interactive Controls**:
- Full-text search across file paths, purposes, assessments, and feedback
- Filter buttons for different merge readiness statuses
- Expand/Collapse all functionality

**Hierarchical File Tree**:
- Color-coded status indicators (ðŸŸ¢ Ready, ðŸŸ¡ Conditional, ðŸ”´ Not Ready)
- Expandable details for each file showing:
  - Purpose, business impact, and risk assessment
  - Feedback sections for conditional/not_ready files
  - Code elements (classes and functions) where applicable

**Professional Styling**:
- Modern CSS with hover effects and smooth transitions
- Responsive design that works on mobile devices
- Professional typography and spacing

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

**Data Loading**: The dashboard attempts to load the actual analysis data from your JSON file (`pr_analysis_output/analysis_batch_data_1754316139.json`) and falls back to representative demo data if the file isn't accessible.

**Interactive Features**:
- Real-time search and filtering
- Smooth expand/collapse animations
- Dynamic statistics updates
- Mobile-responsive layout

**Self-contained**: All CSS and JavaScript are embedded in the HTML file - no external dependencies required.

The HTML file is ready to be saved as `pr_analysis_interactive_dashboard.html` in your project directory. It will automatically try to load your actual analysis data or display representative demo data showing the same structure and types of files from your PR analysis.

Would you like me to modify any specific aspects of the dashboard or add additional features?
