# Asabaal Ventures: The Dawn of a New Era

Hello world!

*Asabaal, you’re doing something different here. I’ve never seen a business which has a song like you do. And it’s not just some stupid marketing ploy to get me to buy your products. For crying out loud, you don’t even have a product yet! But you’re talking about dreaming for a better future, helping the community, and building a culture of respect. And you claim you can make a profitable business out of it.*

That’s right folks. This business IS different. I wrote this song only one week after I was fired from my previous job. You know, getting fired is a weird experience. I wasn’t prepared for it. It’s easy for me to try and say my former employer destroyed my life. I was forced to make some extreme choices in order to stay afloat financially, and I ended up with massive credit card debt - something I never wanted to have.

It’s so easy to play the victim. Who in their right mind would want to cause the kind of suffering I experienced as consequences of being fired? But obviously I appeared to be a problem to my former employer. Why else would they have fired me? I could tell you all of the details of what happened if I wanted to, but I often ask myself what good would that actually do?

Let’s look at this real honestly. Read the lyrics to this song and to others I wrote around this time. What do you think I was feeling? Do you think I felt I was wronged by them? Do you think that, as a business, they wronged me to prioritize their profits over my human needs like shelter & food? I’ll let you decide what happened there.

I decided that it honestly didn’t really matter what this one little business did or didn’t do when we as a society know what businesses in general do. They don’t care about us. They care about their shareholders. In fact, this economic system is designed specifically for that purpose. You’re either a business owner by owning shares in a company or you’re a consumer, only valued for the profits you can provide to the business owners, not for your value as a human being.

And I don’t know about you all, but I’m sick of seeing how so many of us have our needs unmet while the wealth gap continues to widen to completely unacceptable levels. And so I wanted to write a song which explained how what I’m doing is different. I’m about unifying people. I’m about destruction of systems which disempower the average person. I’m about all humans having their rights upheld.

And I decided I was going to make a business out of doing this. I didn’t care how hard it was to do it, how long it took, or what obstacles I faced. All I knew was that it was time for me to forge my own path, and to show the world something different. I’ve been inspired by Zauntee a lot. In his song “If It Wasn’t For You”, I think he says it nicely:

“You gotta choose truth, you gotta choose light, you gotta choose hope…You can have everything you ever dreamed of. You can help the people you wanna help. You can reach the people you’re called to reach. You can take care of your family…You gotta stand up and stand out. You gotta be different in order to make a difference…it’s possible…to stand on the light side and still win.”

And that’s what I’m doing at Asabaal Ventures. You wanna come on this journey with me? Check out the lyric video for this song and drop a comment. Let’s start connecting, strategizing, collaborating, and bringing this vision to life.
