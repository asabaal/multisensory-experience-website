CONDITIONAL FILES (18):
- assets/js/contact-forms.js: Consider adding rate limiting for form submissions, validate Discord webhook configuration before use, and implement proper error logging for production debugging.
- assets/js/forms.js: This appears to duplicate functionality from contact-forms.js. Consider consolidating or clearly defining the separation of concerns between these two files.
- assets/js/supabase-client.js: Add input sanitization for all user inputs, implement proper error codes for different failure types, and consider adding request retry logic for network failures.
- content/auto_blog_processor.py: This processor attempts to call Claude Code via subprocess but uses commands that may not exist ('claude', 'claude code'). The error handling is good but the core functionality relies on CLI commands that are not validated. Consider removing or updating to use working CLI patterns.
- content/automated_blog_processor.py: Similar issues to auto_blog_processor.py - attempts multiple CLI calling strategies but relies on commands that may not exist. The fallback to manual process is good UX. Consider consolidating with the main processor or removing redundant implementations.
- content/blog/published/2024-08-22_collaborative-business-models-ethical-advertising/post.json: The featured_video section at line 22-27 has inconsistent formatting - 'video' property contains markdown-style text '**Publish Date**: 20240822' instead of proper video metadata. Should be structured like other video sections with url, title, and description properties.
- content/blog/published/2024-08-26_the-future-of-work-and-personal-growth-cultivating-fulfillment-in-the-changing-landscape-of-work/post.json: The featured-video section at lines 21-27 has inconsistent structure - uses 'videos' array with markdown-style content '**Publish Date**: 20240826' instead of proper video metadata structure with url, title, and description.
- content/blog/published/2024-08-26_why-i-entered-the-ai-remix-competition/post.json: The featured_video section at lines 22-28 uses 'videos' array format instead of the standard video object structure. Should be consistent with other posts that use single video object with url, title, and description properties.
- content/blog/published/2024-09-11_omniscient-what-does-that-actually-mean/post.json: The image section at lines 47-52 uses 'imageUrl' property instead of the standard 'src' property used in other posts. Should be consistent with the standard image object structure using 'src', 'alt', and optional 'caption' properties.
- content/blog/published/2024-11-08_no-fighting-the-evil-inside-yourself/post.json: The featured_video section at lines 21-26 uses 'featured_video' type instead of the standard 'video' type used in other posts. For consistency, should use 'video' type like the first file in this batch.
- content/blog/published/2024-11-15_keep-it-simple-simple-indeed/post.json: The featured_video section at lines 22-27 uses 'featured_video' type instead of the standard 'video' type. For consistency across the blog system, should use 'video' type.
- content/blog/published/2024-11-22_power-of-pain-you-already-feel-it-leverage-it/post.json: The featured video section at lines 22-27 uses 'featured-video' type (with hyphen) and 'videoUrl' property instead of the standard 'video' type and 'url' property used consistently in other posts.
- content/blog/published/2024-12-06_special-we-are-all-special-this-is-a-special-time-in-history-lets-get-moving/post.json: The featured_video section at lines 21-26 uses 'featured_video' type instead of the standard 'video' type used in other posts. For consistency, should use 'video' type.
- content/blog/published/2024-12-27_probably-right-accepting-criticism-with-humility/post.json: The featured_video section at lines 22-27 uses 'featured_video' type instead of the standard 'video' type. For consistency across the blog system, should use 'video' type.
- content/blog/published/2025-01-17_asabaal-ventures-dawn-new-era/post.json: Two issues: 1) The featured_video section at lines 22-28 uses 'featured_video' type instead of standard 'video' type, and 2) The image section at lines 81-86 uses 'imageUrl' property instead of the standard 'src' property used consistently in other posts.
- content/blog/published/2025-07-29_human-creativity-ai-ethical-social-platforms/post.json: Two issues: 1) The featured-video section at lines 22-28 uses 'featured-video' type and 'videoUrl' property instead of standard 'video' type and 'url' property, and 2) The videoUrl contains invalid content '**Publish Date**: 20240823' instead of a proper YouTube URL.
- database-archive/blog-database/supabase-config.js: The configuration contains placeholder credentials ('your-project-id', 'your-anon-key-here') which are exposed in browser-accessible JavaScript. While this is archived code, consider adding comments indicating these are templates only and should never contain real credentials in client-side code.
- prototypes/Pitch Deck Updated 20250714.html: File appears to be quite large (1545 lines). Consider optimizing for web delivery or converting to a more appropriate format for web viewing. Large HTML presentation files can impact page load times.

The status is 'draft', title is generic, excerpt says 'Add your post excerpt here...', subtitle says 'Add your subtitle here...', and intro text says 'Add your introduction here...'.

- content/content/blog/published/2026-06-04_special_we_are_all_special_this_is_a_special_time_in_history_lets_get_moving/post.json: This is a template file with placeholder content that should not be published. The status is 'draft', publish date is set to 2026 (unrealistic future date), excerpt says 'Add your post excerpt here...', and all content sections contain placeholder text. The future date suggests this may be test data or improperly configured content.
- content/content/blog/published/hurts_probably_right_youre_probably_right_and_so_am_i_even_when_it/post.json: This is a template file with significant issues. The publish date is set to 'hurts' (invalid date format), status is 'draft', and all content contains placeholder text. The filename structure suggests this may be a processing error where the date got corrupted. This should not be published without proper content and metadata.
- content/raw-input/.md: This file is essentially empty with only placeholder content. It has no title (just '#'), generic placeholder text, and empty asset fields. This appears to be an incomplete or corrupted template file that should either be properly completed or removed.
- database-archive/supabase-keys.prod.js: File does not exist or is not accessible. This is a critical configuration file required for production deployment. Either the file needs to be created with proper production keys or the deployment configuration needs to be updated to handle missing production keys gracefully.
- database-archive/supabase-setup.sql: File does not exist or is not accessible. This appears to be a core database setup file that would be essential for initializing the application's database schema. Without this file, the application cannot establish its database structure, making deployment impossible.
- assets/images/icons/cosmic_nebula.svg: CRITICAL ISSUES: 1) File size is 1.7MB, which is extremely large for an icon (typical icons should be <50KB). 2) SVG contains embedded base64-encoded PNG data rather than vector graphics, defeating the purpose of SVG format. 3) Dimensions are 1920x1080 pixels, appropriate for a background image but not an icon. 4) File should be moved to appropriate directory (likely assets/images/backgrounds/) and optimized. 5) If needed as an icon, should be redesigned as proper vector graphics at appropriate dimensions (<100x100px).
