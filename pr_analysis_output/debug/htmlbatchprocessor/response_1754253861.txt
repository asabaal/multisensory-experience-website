I've created a comprehensive interactive HTML dashboard for the PR analysis results with hierarchical file-level visualization. The dashboard includes:

## Key Features:

**🎯 Interactive Design:**
- Dark theme (#0f0f23 background) with modern UI
- Tabbed interface with 5 main sections
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Professional styling with gradients and shadows

**📊 Executive Summary:**
- Key metrics display (245 files, merge status, quality scores)
- High-level findings and risk assessment
- Critical issue identification

**🌳 Hierarchical File Analysis:**
- Interactive tree view of all 245+ files
- Expandable/collapsible file details
- Color-coded merge readiness indicators (🟢 🟡 🔴)
- Search functionality across all files
- Filter by status (All/Ready/Conditional/Not Ready)
- Detailed file assessments with purpose, business impact, and risk

**⚠️ Quality Issues Section:**
- Critical, high, and medium priority issues
- Impact scores and affected file counts
- Detailed descriptions of each issue

**📋 Duplicate Analysis:**
- Critical database setup file conflicts
- Deployment guide duplications
- Blog processing script redundancies

**💡 Recommendations:**
- Prioritized action items with color coding
- Estimated effort calculations
- Specific guidance for each issue type

**🔧 Technical Implementation:**
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Client-side search and filtering
- Expandable file details with code elements
- Custom scrollbars and modern CSS

The dashboard processes the actual analysis results from your PR, showing that 198 files are ready for merge, 18 need conditional review, and 29 are not ready (mostly template files with placeholder content). The file would be saved as `pr_analysis_dashboard_complete.html` in your pr_analysis_output directory.
