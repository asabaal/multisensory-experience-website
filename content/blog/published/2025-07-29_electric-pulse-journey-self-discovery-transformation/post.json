Music is one of my top passions, and you should expect to see that as an important outlet to convey information. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to conceptualize my ideas and start getting them from my head and onto paper, with only limited success."

But this video was different. I found out that we finally had a decent AI for making music! I couldn't contain my excitement! Within a couple days, I had this song.",

I didn't spend the most time invested in the lyrical or musical quality of this song; however, after I was finished with it, I was ready to show the world what I can do, because this is only the beginning.",
            "This song was written to represent coming into a new state of being or obtaining some new insight or accomplishment. I imagined what it would be like to first become self-aware, not as a child, but as an adult with a fully-formed mind, a command of language, and the ability to learn. The electric pulse represents the initial spark of this new life. I imagine this experience as like awakening from a shadow experience, recognizing the vastness of existence and the minuteness of one's self."

I believe it is fundamentally necessary to effectively merge logical thinking and emotions to achieve the next level of self-awareness and overall intelligence. Then I share where my journey has taken me - I want to push the boundaries of knowledge and face all of the fears which have held me back, and I have been doing it.",
            "I am a person of faith myself - it's in my very name! So for me, the mysteries of the soul are also tightly knit with my spirituality and this song represents spiritual awakening to start walking in your purpose."

I used to think self-reflection & meditation was a useless endeavor, and I am so sorry for myself that I ever believed that. Coming to the revelation of who you are is so critical and life-giving.",

From my Christian perspective, it also serves to remind me of the power you feel when you welcome the Holy Spirit and become the new creation you were destined to be (2 Cor. 5:17). It's about transcending the mold of who we thought we were and embracing the endless possibilities of who we can become."

The dynamic build-up of the bridge and the powerful, anthemic chorus aim to create a sense of liberation and empowerment."
