# Special: We are all special. This is a special time in history. Let’s get moving!

Hello World!

As always, I’m excited to share more with you! Things have really changed a lot for me in my life and for my business! I was just realizing as I watched the lyric video for this song for quality assurance that I need to update my QR code page to link y’all directly to my Suno playlist now that I’ve dropped all those songs!

I’m really excited to keep things moving too! But not every change always feels positive. I’ve hit a period of deceleration with Asabaal Ventures because it’s time for me to level up. I’ve hit the end of my (at least initial) ideation phase, and I’m gearing up for complete operationalization of the business!

I think you’re gonna love what I’m working on! The downside of this is that I am currently unable to accomplish everything I want to for the business, and that means some things are coming out at slightly lower quality on top of the lower rate than I’d like them to. So I just wanna thank everyone for your patience.

This song is special to me. Yes, I just went there. There’s a number of reasons, but I don’t want to spoil everything now. These blog posts on my songs are really just the very beginning of an entire content empire than is coming! These posts are just to whet your appetite, to pique your curiosity, and encourage you to follow me and subscribe to my YouTube channel so you can stay up to date on what I’m up to.

One of the reasons this song is special to me is that it was the first song I wrote that I couldn’t finish with Suno V3, the version of Suno that was available when I wrote it. I had something, but I really wasn’t feeling it. And honestly, I’m not even sure I love the version I have now. I’ve matured enough in my musical career to recognize by ear and by lyricism what songs seem to be better than others.

I’m going to measure that with data. I’m a trained physicist, for crying out loud, and a well-practiced professional data scientist! AND I’m already using AI to help me write music! So I figure why not use AI to help me measure the quality of my own music and improve on it in the future?

After Suno V 3.5 dropped, I was able to go back to this song and a few others which I haven’t talked about yet (but are now streaming on Suno), and used the new version to make the songs better! There’s a huge movement in the music industry against AI creators, but I think that’s absurd. AI is here to stay, and creators supercharged by AI like myself are the ones who will be taking the lead.

Fortunately, there are also some creators who favor AI. I love that Suno started running contests with well-known artists. I entered both the Flosstradamus and the Timbaland contests! And I love that Suno brought Timbaland on to help improve their product! AI music is gonna get so much better so fast!

I’m not gonna share any more about the story behind the song in this post. My lyrics are self-explanatory for the most part across all of my songs. I think the message is clear. If someone is curious about what I’m saying, I want to hear from you! Please ask questions! I want to start conversations with people!

I want to run the largest social campaigns in history! We as humans are indeed all special, and I want to hear your stories. I want to share your stories. I want to fight for you and with you against the system and for our good. I honestly can’t believe all of the things happening in my life. I’m excited! There’s a lot of hard stuff, I’m not gonna lie. My story is powerful, and that’s scary even to me.

But I tell you what - I can’t wait to get far enough along so I can start touring! As a Christian, I was raised to believe that we are supposed to “go” into the world. I want to go all over and meet you, sharing my vision, offering my services, and building communities.

I am special, yes. And you are special. You are special to me. And I believe you are special to God. I believe that our combined specialties along with modern technology can truly overcome all major problems we perceive in our lives, and I’m gonna have a great time following how they’re being solved and solving some myself!

I’m gearing up for a great run! We’re gonna have so much fun! Asabaal Ventures is gonna bring the heat, and the experiences coming your way are gonna be amazing! Let’s have some fun!
