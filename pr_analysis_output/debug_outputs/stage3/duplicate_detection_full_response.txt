Based on my analysis of the duplicate analysis data, I've identified several types of duplicates in your codebase. Here's my comprehensive duplicate file report:

## **CRITICAL: Exact/Near-Exact Duplicates**

### Database Setup Files (HIGH PRIORITY)
- `supabase-setup.sql` (lines: 228, size: 7707)
- `supabase-minimal-setup.sql` (lines: 55, size: 1845) 
- `supabase-community-migration.sql` (lines: 246, size: 8276)

**Evidence**: All three serve the same core purpose of setting up Supabase database tables. The minimal version appears to be a streamlined subset, while the community migration adds Discord integration features to the base setup.

### Deployment Guides (CRITICAL)
- `VERCEL-DEPLOY.md` (lines: 159, size: 4597)
- `VERCEL-DEPLOY-SIMPLE.md` (lines: 98, size: 3071)
- `DEPLOY-READY.md` (lines: 102, size: 3193)

**Evidence**: All three documents contain nearly identical Vercel deployment instructions with slight variations in organization and detail level. Content samples show repeated sections on Supabase setup and deployment steps.

## **HIGH: Functional Duplicates with Different Implementations**

### Database Schema Files
- `supabase/schema.sql` (lines: 192, size: 6700)
- `supabase/migrations/001_initial_setup.sql` (lines: 95, size: 3274)

**Evidence**: Both create the same blog database structure but using different approaches - one as a complete schema, the other as an incremental migration.

### Configuration Files  
- `config/supabase-config.js` (lines: 62, size: 1736)
- `config/supabase-keys.prod.js` (lines: 13, size: 589)
- `.env.example` (lines: 14, size: 974)

**Evidence**: All three handle Supabase configuration but in different formats - JavaScript object, production keys file, and environment variables template.

### Phase Concept Files (Abandoned Implementations)
- `Initial Phases Concepts/phase-2.html` through `phase-5.html`
- `ecosystem-diagram.html`

**Evidence**: These appear to be iterative prototypes/mockups of the same phase-based rollout concept, with each building on similar visual and structural patterns.

## **MEDIUM: Similar Purpose, Potentially Consolidatable**

### Documentation Files
- `README-SUPABASE.md` (lines: 89, size: 3111)  
- `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` (lines: 232, size: 6360)
- `TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md` (lines: 309, size: 9752)

**Evidence**: Overlapping content about Supabase setup and technical architecture, but serving different audiences/detail levels.

### Visualization Files  
- `visualizations/enhanced-ecosystem-with-finance.html`
- `visualizations/enhanced-ecosystem-with-gaming.html` 
- `visualizations/cooperative-kingdom-ecosystem-fixed.html`

**Evidence**: Multiple HTML visualizations of the same ecosystem concept with incremental feature additions (gaming, finance, cooperative model).

### Database Design Documentation
- `database-design.md` (lines: 153, size: 7982)
- `visual-er-diagram.md` (lines: 120, size: 4456)

**Evidence**: Both document database design decisions but in different formats - written analysis vs visual diagrams.

## **Recommendations**

1. **CRITICAL**: Consolidate the 3 deployment guides into one canonical `DEPLOYMENT.md`
2. **CRITICAL**: Choose one primary database setup file and archive others
3. **HIGH**: Merge Supabase configuration approaches into a single pattern
4. **MEDIUM**: Archive old phase concept prototypes in a `/prototypes` folder
5. **MEDIUM**: Create a single comprehensive visualization with all features integrated

The most impactful cleanup would be consolidating the deployment guides and database setup files, as these create confusion for new developers trying to set up the project.
