I've created a comprehensive interactive HTML dashboard for the PR analysis results with hierarchical file-level visualization. The dashboard includes:

## Key Features:

1. **Dark Theme Design** (#0f0f23 background, professional styling)
2. **5 Interactive Tabs:**
   - 📊 Executive Summary - Key metrics and findings
   - 🌳 Hierarchical Analysis - Interactive file tree with detailed analysis
   - ⚠️ Quality Issues - Breakdown of critical and medium priority issues
   - 📋 Duplicate Files - Analysis of duplicate and redundant files
   - 💡 Recommendations - Prioritized action items

3. **Hierarchical File Visualization:**
   - Expandable file tree showing all 245 analyzed files
   - Color-coded merge readiness indicators (🟢 ready, 🟡 conditional, 🔴 not ready)
   - Search functionality across file paths, purposes, and feedback
   - Filter by merge readiness status
   - Detailed assessment for each file showing purpose, business impact, and risk assessment

4. **Interactive Features:**
   - Real-time search and filtering
   - Expandable file details with assessment grids
   - Code elements display (classes/functions) when available
   - Feedback highlighting for conditional and not-ready items
   - Responsive design for mobile devices

5. **Comprehensive Data Display:**
   - Executive summary with key statistics (198 ready, 18 conditional, 29 not ready)
   - Detailed quality issues breakdown
   - Duplicate file analysis with categorization
   - Prioritized recommendations by severity

The dashboard loads the actual analysis data from the batch JSON file and provides a professional, comprehensive view of all 245 files with their merge readiness status, detailed assessments, and specific feedback for items requiring attention.

To use the dashboard, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. The file attempts to load the actual batch data but includes fallback sample data for demonstration purposes.
