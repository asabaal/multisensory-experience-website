You are generating HTML file tree sections from Stage 7 detailed analysis results.

TASK: Create interactive HTML dashboard for PR analysis results with hierarchical file-level visualization

REQUIREMENTS:
- Dark theme (#0f0f23 background, light text) 
- Show ALL specific findings from agent responses
- Interactive features: tabs, collapsible sections, search, hierarchical tree views
- Professional layout with modern CSS/JS
- Hierarchical file analysis with expandable tree structure (File â†’ Class â†’ Function levels)

DATA FILES TO READ:
- debug_outputs/stage3/duplicate_detection_full_response.txt

- debug_outputs/stage6/PR_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md
- debug_outputs/stage6/combined_results.json
- detailed_analysis_results.json (Stage 7 hierarchical file analysis)
- detailed_analysis_summary.txt (Stage 7 summary)

SECTIONS TO INCLUDE:
1. Executive Summary (metrics, merge status, issue counts)
2. Hierarchical File Analysis (NEW - interactive tree view of files/classes/functions with merge readiness)
3. Quality Issues (all issues with impact scores, recommendations)
4. Duplicate Files (specific files found with evidence)
5. Recommendations (prioritized action items)

HIERARCHICAL VISUALIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Interactive tree structure showing File â†’ Class â†’ Function hierarchy
