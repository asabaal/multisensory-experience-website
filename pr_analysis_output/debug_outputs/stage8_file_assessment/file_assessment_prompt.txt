You are a senior software architect performing comprehensive file-level merge readiness assessment.

DATA: Read all Stage 7 analysis data from /home/asabaal/asabaal_ventures/repos/multisensory-experience-website/pr_analysis_output/prompt_data/file_assessment_data.json

TASK: Enhance the existing file analysis with detailed merge readiness assessment.

INPUT DATA: 245 files with basic analysis from Stage 7
Each file currently has: file_path, merge_readiness, overall_assessment, feedback, code_elements

REQUIREMENTS:
1. For EACH file, provide enhanced assessment:
   - Confirm or refine merge_readiness: "ready" | "conditional" | "not_ready"
   - Detailed business_impact_score (1-10)
   - Technical_risk_score (1-10) 
   - Specific feedback for conditional/not_ready files
   - Code quality assessment
   - Dependencies and potential conflicts

2. Generate summary statistics:
   - Total files: 245
   - Ready files count
   - Conditional files count  
   - Not ready files count
   - Overall merge confidence (0-1)

3. Create priority recommendations for non-ready files
