## Opening Reflection
If you made it here, thank you! You're one of the real ones! Or are you?
What is it that makes us who we are, truly? 

In this song, I explore that question from a faith-aware perspective without relying heavily on spiritual language to make it more accessible to a larger audience.
We learn from the biblical prophets Samuel (1 Sam. 16:7) and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 17:10) that it is not what is immediately perceivable that determines one's value and identity. I had forgotten the existence of the Jeremiah passage when I sat down to write this post, and I love what it says: 

"I the LORD test the mind and search the heart, to give to all according to their ways, according to the fruit of their doings."

Let us learn from the prophets' revelation as we carry ourselves.

## Commentary
I posted last year on my Facebook that this year, I am targeting the initial launch of my project "I Never Asked To Be Queer" this year. In this season of Musical Poetry with Asabaal, I have selected 8 out of the 25 pieces to share AI versions of, along with these posts. Without further ado, let's dig right in!

Who do you think I am? Have you stopped and taken a moment to think? When I wrote this song, I was near the beginning of my reconstruction journey. I had accepted I was different than most, and that it had come with a calling on my life. I would call it the will of God. You might call it something else. I believed the way I saw the world allowed for the construction of a stable, unified reality of peace. And I still do. 
I was two failed marriages into my life, certainty of life completely eroded, wrestling between navigating the challenges of daily life and pursuing the call God had placed on me, even though I didn't really understand what that meant.
My default mode at home was toxicity, and I had finally learned to acknowledge that so I could change. I had a terrible fight with my partner. I didn't see her for days. In my grief and processing, I wrote this piece with both her and you, the future reader and listener, in mind. Knowing that it was my behaviors that typically caused others to see me as less than in whatever it was, I yearned a language for shared understanding. For me, this piece represents a foundational moment in my journey. 
No human is perfect. No animal is perfect.  Reality itself is imperfect. And yet I said I would worship a perfect God. The cognitive dissonance this caused me was too great. My depression had held me down for too long. And truthfully, I was afraid to say too much about my faith in my music because I didn't know how to talk about it coherently. The queerness didn't sit well with many conservative Christians who believed they were upholding moral standards and biblical authority, when in reality they neglected the acceptance of theological diversity in place of doctrinal supremacy. So it didn't matter whether it was the church folks who treated me poorly or humans/systems "in the wild" that treated me poorly, I felt excluded and alone.

As is my style, I could hone in on different lyrical elements from the piece, or I could simply share my thoughts like this and invite you to listen and read the lyrics if you desire. I have intentinally presented my work in a multisensory fashion because it is precisely this technique that has great effect in heighteing the signal to noise ratio in the reality signals I construct and propagate out into reality. When I started Asabaal Ventures, I didn't have the language for what it was that I was doing, and I was mostly illegible when I attempted to convey my vision to others. Now that I have the term "Reality Studio" and I have been developing comprehensive language and predictive, mythic models of reality, I can finally see with confidence that everything I have done from the beginning up until now has been in line with diving right in to the studio and getting to work before I knew it was that. Does this mean I was always a Reality Studio owner/operator, and it was only revealed to me in due time?

This piece is only the beginning of this narrative thread in the Asabaal Ventures Reality Studio ecosystem. And it's not in its final form either. Reality is evolving, and so should the signals I construct and emit in order to align with reality's changing nature. One thing that remains true across all my body of work - it's meant to spend some time with. Engage with my reality. Step inside my mind, see the world model I use to explain and prescribe actions. These are my doings. This is fruit from my doings as well. When I wrote this piece, I wanted you to test your mind and search your heart, as I promise to do for those who engage reality with me.

## Closing Reflection

May you find rest for your mind and peace for your soul. May you, like the LORD, search that you may find, and be transformed. Reality is calling. Are you going to answer?
