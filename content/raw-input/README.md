# Raw Input Directory

This directory contains simple template files for creating blog posts. 

## How to Use

1. **Copy the TEMPLATE.md file** and rename it to your post slug (e.g., `my-new-post.md`)
2. **Fill in your content** - just copy/paste and write naturally
3. **Tell Claude** when you're ready to convert it to the JSON format

## File Naming Convention
Use the slug format: `your-post-title-here.md`

Example: `embracing-creative-collaboration.md`

## What Happens Next
Claude will:
1. Take your raw input file
2. Convert it to the proper JSON structure
3. Place it in the correct published directory
4. Update any necessary data files
