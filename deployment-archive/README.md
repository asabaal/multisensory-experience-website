## Consolidation Notes
These files were archived on 2025-08-01 as part of documentation consolidation to:
- Eliminate confusion from multiple deployment guides
- Create a single comprehensive deployment resource
- Maintain platform flexibility while reducing maintenance overhead
- Provide clearer, step-by-step instructions for all deployment scenarios

The new `DEPLOYMENT.md` combines the best elements from all three guides:
- Comprehensive Supabase setup from all guides
- Multiple platform options from `DEPLOY-READY.md`
- Detailed Vercel instructions from `VERCEL-DEPLOY.md`
- Simplified approach from `VERCEL-DEPLOY-SIMPLE.md`
- Enhanced troubleshooting and security sections

If you need to reference any specific instructions from these archived guides, they remain fully functional - however, `DEPLOYMENT.md` should be used as the primary reference going forward.
