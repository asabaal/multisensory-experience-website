Based on the analysis data available, I can see that this is a detailed analysis request, but the analysis data shows no files were actually analyzed (total_files: 0, empty file_classifications and file_contents). Given the requirement to return valid JSON and the lack of actual file data to analyze, I'll return a response indicating insufficient data.
