But as I saw the bird imagery in the AI-generated art for the track, it hit me â€“ achieving inner freedom feels like entering a life you previously thought was impossible, yet it is so satisfying! This inner peace I have feels like being as free as a bird, flying for the first time.",
            "The first chorus sets the tone for the entire song, representing the process of looking beyond the physical world and delving into the depths of one's soul. After I came out, I started getting a lot of hate from my connections in the Christian community, and I knew I was going to continue to get more as a queer Christian."

I talk about feeling lost in time, representing the notion of eternity, which we tap into when we connect with God through meditation (Psa 90:4, 2 Pet 3:8).",

People are neglecting their needs, suffering from mental and physical illnesses, so many of which could, in principle, be treated.",
