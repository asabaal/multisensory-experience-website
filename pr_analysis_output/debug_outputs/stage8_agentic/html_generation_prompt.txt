You are generating a complete PR analysis HTML dashboard.

TEMPLATE: Use the working HTML template at /home/asabaal/asabaal_ventures/repos/asabaal-utils/src/templates/working_html_template.html as your base structure.

DATA: Read all analysis data from /home/asabaal/asabaal_ventures/repos/multisensory-experience-website/pr_analysis_output/prompt_data/html_generation_data.json


CRITICAL: Stage 8 comprehensive file assessment data is available with:
- 245 files with enhanced assessment scores
- 198 ready, 18 conditional, 29 not ready
- Full enhanced data in file_assessment.file_assessments array
- Each file has: merge_readiness, business_impact_score, technical_risk_score, overall_assessment, detailed_feedback, code_elements, recommendations

MANDATORY: You MUST include ALL 245 files in the JavaScript fileData array. Do not truncate, sample, or skip any files. Every single file in the file_assessments array must be represented in your HTML output.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use the EXACT HTML structure from the template file
2. Replace ALL template variables with actual data from the JSON file
3. For file analysis content, use the most comprehensive file data available:
   - Prioritize file_assessment.file_assessments if available (enhanced with scores and recommendations)  
   - Fall back to detailed_analysis.file_analyses if needed
   - CRITICAL: Include EVERY SINGLE file from the data - no truncation, sampling, or omission allowed
   - Generate proper HTML with file-item divs and appropriate CSS classes
   - Include expandable details with all available assessment information
4. Keep all CSS and JavaScript exactly as in the template
5. Use data-driven approach - adapt to whatever fields are available in the JSON

CRITICAL: For the file data section, include EXACTLY this placeholder (and nothing else):
        // INJECT_COMPLETE_FILE_DATA_HERE
        
Do NOT create any const fileData declaration. Do NOT create any empty arrays. The complete file data and variable declarations will be injected programmatically.

IMPORTANT: Your response must be ONLY the complete HTML code starting with <!DOCTYPE html> and ending with </html>. No explanations - just the final HTML file content.
