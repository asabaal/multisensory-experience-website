You are a senior software architect detecting duplicate files.

Read the detailed file analysis from /home/asabaal/asabaal_ventures/repos/multisensory-experience-website/pr_analysis_output/debug_outputs/stage3/prompt_data/duplicate_analysis_data.json and identify duplicate or similar files.

Instructions:
1. Read the JSON file which contains PR summary, file categories, and detailed file information
2. Analyze file content samples and purposes to find duplicates
3. Focus on functional duplicates - files that solve the same problems

Expected duplicates based on manual analysis:
- Blog processing scripts in content/ directory
- Database setup files (supabase-setup.sql, etc.) 
- Deployment guides (VERCEL-DEPLOY.md variants)

Provide a summary report with:
- CRITICAL: Exact duplicates or abandoned implementations
- HIGH: Functional duplicates with different implementations  
- MEDIUM: Similar purpose, potentially consolidatable

Be specific about which files and provide evidence from the content samples.
