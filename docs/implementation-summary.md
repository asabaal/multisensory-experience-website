## What's Left to Do

### 1. Image Assets

  - `stars-bg.jpg` - Subtle stars pattern for backgrounds

### 2. HTML Updates
- Update references to logo images
- Update tagline to "Monetizing Fulfillment, Peace, & Truth"
- Update page titles and headings
- Add the RESPECT section to the Approach page

### 3. Testing and Refinement
- Test responsiveness across device sizes
- Ensure color contrast meets accessibility standards
- Test form submission functionality

## Implementation Tips

### Using CSS Variables
Our implementation uses CSS variables extensively for consistency. You can easily tweak the appearance by adjusting the variables in `variables.css`:

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #e27a9e;
  /* Other variables */
}
```

### Special Elements

#### Spiritual Concepts
To highlight spiritual concepts within text:

```html
<p>Our approach centers on <span class="spiritual-concept">Collective Resonance</span> and mindful engagement.</p>
```

#### Gradient Text
For eye-catching gradient text effects:

```html
<h1 class="text-gradient">Monetizing Fulfillment, Peace, & Truth</h1>
```

#### Cosmic Cards
For card elements with the cosmic theme:

```html
<div class="feature-card cosmic-overlay">
  <!-- Card content -->
</div>
```
