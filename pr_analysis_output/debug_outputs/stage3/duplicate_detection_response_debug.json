Here's my comprehensive duplicate file report:\n\n## **CRITICAL: Exact/Near-Exact Duplicates**\n\n### Database Setup Files (HIGH PRIORITY)\n- `supabase-setup.sql` (lines: 228, size: 7707)\n- `supabase-minimal-setup.sql` (lines: 55, size: 1845) \n- `supabase-community-migration.sql` (lines: 246, size: 8276)\n\n**Evidence**: All three serve the same core purpose of setting up Supabase database tables. The minimal version appears to be a streamlined subset, while the community migration adds Discord integration features to the base setup.\n\n### Deployment Guides (CRITICAL)\n- `VERCEL-DEPLOY.md` (lines: 159, size: 4597)\n- `VERCEL-DEPLOY-SIMPLE.md` (lines: 98, size: 3071)\n- `DEPLOY-READY.md` (lines: 102, size: 3193)\n\n**Evidence**: All three documents contain nearly identical Vercel deployment instructions with slight variations in organization and detail level.
