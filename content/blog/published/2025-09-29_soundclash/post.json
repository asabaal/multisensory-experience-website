Not today. Today I want to start opening up about my own struggles more directly. The messaging of a better life and a better world is still here, but it’s time to start digging underneath the surface to see what made Asabaal the woman she is."

In fact, the prompt I used to generate the intro for this song was “Shoegazer trap, omniscient EDM”. I wanted this song to sound like it was everything, and therefore it knew everything, to be a reflection of what it might mean to be omniscient."

This journey has me, the human in the loop and even as the guide.",
            "Instead, I want to focus on the feelings I wanted to evoke from this piece. You may notice I didn’t actually tell very much about my story in this song. That was intentional. I wanted to give you an inkling of what is to come, as well as an insight into some of the feelings I have faced in my life.",
            "I have struggled with anxiety for the entirety of my life, and I wasn’t treated for nearly 30 years, for lack of recognition of the issue! It took even longer for me to accept my depression and be treated for that as well. This song sheds some light on how that felt. I felt alone. I didn’t know who I should be. All I could do was hope that I didn’t lose everything. And that failed. At least that’s how I felt."

I have spent so much of my life feeling like a loser and desperate for help. I literally felt without purpose. This isn’t to say there was no one who believed I had something great to offer, but I rejected their input because I couldn’t see the pathway to accomplishing something.",
            "I felt forced into this life of failure and misery. It led me to depressive episodes full of tears, where I begged God for help in a broken, ghastly voice. I wanted to get that feeling of sinking in my chest out of me, but I couldn’t do it. I didn’t have a choice but to deal with it. I thought this was all life was.",
            "I knew I had done terrible things over and over again, but through it all, I chose to believe that there was a way out. I came to a conclusion. I asked myself the question, “What exactly does it mean to be omniscient?” Since I already believed in God and believed that God is omniscient (Psa 139:1-3, Is 46:9-10, Heb 4:13), I figured having a good understanding of what this actually is would be beneficial."

            "That makes it possible to let go of the unknown. That makes it possible to have a worry-free life, to have a life where you let go of your preconceived notions that lead to negative outcomes. It makes it possible to acknowledge you are sick mentally for having them and letting them drive you. It lets you acknowledge that you need to be refined, to have a life where you rise above these things into the life you were always meant for.",
