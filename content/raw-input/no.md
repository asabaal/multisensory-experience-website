# No - Fighting the Evil Inside of Yourself

Hello world,

Do you know that feeling when someone has wronged you, and it just pisses you off beyond belief!? You want to do something about it! You want to fight back, and stand up for yourself! What about that feeling when you know you can do something about it, but you know it’s a bad idea to do so? It might not even matter if you do everything right, it’s simply just a bad idea to do anything in response to being treated with disrespect, at least in that moment and with those people or that person.

This song has a lot of big emotions tied to it for me. I think we all know what it feels like to be disrespected. It feels like garbage. You’re gonna hear this theme a lot in my music. I believe that recognizing those feelings and figuring out what you can do about it to solve the problem on a systemic level rather than to retaliate or deal with someone individually or as part of a smaller group is a great way to elevate yourself.

Instincts are really dangerous. That survival mechanism which is baked into the very fabric of our being loves to tell you what it thinks is best, and it’s usually wrong. That’s why I say “No! Reject the fire within! It only leads to sin!” That firey passion is beautiful, and I absolutely love seeing it in people! I believe that our passion drives us to accomplish things that we otherwise wouldn’t believe we are capable of, but it can also be very dangerous if not tamed, just like any other fire.

And I’ll tell you what - that anger certainly doesn’t want me to let them win! They hurt me! They wronged me! They sinned against me! Yeah, they sure did, but sinning against them isn’t gonna fix anything, and we all know that. That’s why I say “when you cave is when they win, you’ll have your chance again”. You will. Don’t doubt it. Have faith and don’t doubt. This is so crucial. You need to absolutely convince yourself that things are going to be ok, and that you will have a chance to do what you think is right in response to how you were wronged.

Guess what? You can create that opportunity to do what you think is right. You can figure out a better way to handle things. And I need that for myself. And I think you need it for yourself too. When I get through the first stage of accepting I need to reject my instincts, and just “let it go”, it’s easy to let that anger turn into depression. That’s my default response honestly. And I think it’s yours too. Of course when someone wrongs you, if you don’t immediately do something about it, it’s gonna hurt, and uncontrolled, it will cause you some level of depression.

No! I hate getting stuck in depression. It makes me just as angry as when someone wrongs me! Except, this time, there is one key difference - instead of being angry at someone else, I’m angry at myself. I’m angry at myself for being depressed, even though it wasn’t my fault that I got depressed in the first place. I’m angry because I haven’t figured out how to break out of the depression.

But we really do have another chance. Every single moment we have a brand new chance to do something different. You always have your chance. Yeah, you’re in the place you’re in, but you can either stay there or not. “Ain’t nobody tell you your fate, ain’t nobody set your goals. Only you control if you’re great, and the health of your beautiful soul”.

As soon as I’ve finished reframing and I set new goals which incorporate a solution to the problem that got me into this state in the first place, I can mostly let go of the depressive feelings. Now I have a new passion to improve myself. I made my own chance. And you can too.

How have you navigated circumstances where you were wronged? How have you failed or succeeded to get through the anger and the depression to get to your new goals? Do you believe you can better yourself despite the fact that you were disrespected? Let me know your thoughts!
