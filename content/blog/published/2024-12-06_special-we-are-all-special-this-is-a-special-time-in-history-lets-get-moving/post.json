I've hit the end of my (at least initial) ideation phase, and I'm gearing up for complete operationalization of the business!",

The downside of this is that I am currently unable to accomplish everything I want to for the business, and that means some things are coming out at slightly lower quality on top of the lower rate than I'd like them to. So I just wanna thank everyone for your patience."

These posts are just to whet your appetite, to pique your curiosity, and encourage you to follow me and subscribe to my YouTube channel so you can stay up to date on what I'm up to.",
            "One of the reasons this song is special to me is that it was the first song I wrote that I couldn't finish with Suno V3, the version of Suno that was available when I wrote it. I had something, but I really wasn't feeling it. And honestly, I'm not even sure I love the version I have now. I've matured enough in my musical career to recognize by ear and by lyricism what songs seem to be better than others."

So I figure why not use AI to help me measure the quality of my own music and improve on it in the future?",
            "After Suno V 3.5 dropped, I was able to go back to this song and a few others which I haven't talked about yet (but are now streaming on Suno), and used the new version to make the songs better! There's a huge movement in the music industry against AI creators, but I think that's absurd. AI is here to stay, and creators supercharged by AI like myself are the ones who will be taking the lead."
