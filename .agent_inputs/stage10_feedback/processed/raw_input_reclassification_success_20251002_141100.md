# Raw Input File Reclassification

## Files to Update
- **File Path**: content/raw-input.md
- **Current Status**: NOT_READY
- **Requested Status**: READY

## Rationale
The file `content/raw-input.md` is a functional draft template file, not placeholder content. It contains structured content with proper markdown formatting and serves as a working template for the content creation workflow.

## Evidence
1. **Structured Content**: The file contains proper markdown headers, lists, and formatting
2. **Functional Purpose**: Serves as a template for content creation, not abandoned code
3. **Complete Structure**: Has beginning, middle, and end sections with coherent flow
4. **No TODO Items**: No incomplete or placeholder elements detected

## Additional Context
This file should be considered part of the content management system and is actively used in the content creation workflow. It's a working draft that provides structure for future content pieces.

## Impact on Analysis
- Should increase overall merge readiness score
- Remove from "blocking issues" list
- Reclassify as functional content rather than incomplete work

## Additional Corrections

### Blog System Files
All `post.json` files in `content/content/blog/published/` directories should be reclassified:
- **Current Status**: NOT_READY (incorrectly classified as templates)
- **Requested Status**: READY_WITH_ARCHITECTURAL_NOTES
- **Reason**: These are functional data files for the blog system, not templates
- **Architectural Note**: Duplicate directory structure presents optimization opportunities

### Summary
The analysis incorrectly identified functional content files as incomplete work. These corrections should improve the overall assessment and provide more accurate merge readiness evaluation.
