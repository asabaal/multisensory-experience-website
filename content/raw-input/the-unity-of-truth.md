# The Unity of Truth: My Next Claim Is That Global Peace Is Inevitable In A World With Democratized Superintelligence

Hello world,

How fitting the lyrics of this song are to today’s world. I guess I don’t have to convince you that there is a problem of polarization in our society. Regardless of where you stand on the political or religious spectrum, it’s pretty easy to see that you don’t agree with each and every person in the world on a number of issues. We simply differ in the ways we believe and how we understand our experiences.

Throughout history, we’ve resorted to violence to resolve our differences. Oftentimes this violence has been religiously motivated – people who firmly believe that their religion is true, and that those who are the subject of their violence are actively seeking to destroy their religion. What makes this even more frustrating to me is that it has come from Christianity repeatedly.

From a musical perspective, this song did *not* do what I was originally hoping it would. I’ve thought about trying again. The timbre changes significantly from the beginning of the song. I decided to go with it, because it felt like the song was taking you on a journey. The journey I wanted to take you on is the journey of discovering what it takes for us to unify. I believe the answer is quite simple: truth.

From a Christian perspective, this is a beautiful way to think about unity because Jesus says in the Bible that the truth sets us free. Jesus also says that he himself is the truth! So if we play this out, in some sense, if truth is to be the unifier between disparate groups, then Jesus is the unifier between these groups.

Then the question becomes this: how do we know what truth is and what it isn’t? I think this can also be answered easily, but the answer is perhaps somewhat less satisfying. I like to think about this from a logical perspective. In undergraduate, when I took a course on proofs in mathematics, one of the first things they taught us was how to determine whether a statement was true.It required a couple of elements: a set of assumptions, and the statement in question.

The way in which the truth of the statement was determined was via a logical proof using statements which logically follow from each other until the desired outcome was achieved - either the statement is true or it is false. In other words, what I’m saying is that we cannot say with 100% certainty that any statement is true or false, because every statement depends on a set of assumptions which are, by definition, not proved, or perhaps even unprovable.

Whether we have described it or not, we each have a world model which describes what our assumptions and proofs are. Now, disagreement on whether a particular statement is true can be framed as identifying differences in the structure of the world models of individuals. For now, let’s assume that everyone is capable of thinking completely rationally and will do so when prompted to. I claim that, under this assumption, complete alignment in all humans’ world models is not only possible, but inevitable, and will happen as the intelligence explosion reaches its end.

Of course we know that it isn’t quite that simple, but once we have superintelligence, it should be a trivial exercise to determine why one is not acting rationally when prompted to, and how to properly empathize in order to remedy that issue. And once we’ve hit this future, regardless of what it looks like, we will have a clear pathway to global peace, and it will happen at least by the time that humanity effectively knows everything there possibly is to know, if not much sooner than that.

This is my next claim. That global peace is not only possible, but inevitable, on the longest timescales. Do you want to be a part of making that happen? That’s what I’m doing. And that’s why I encouraged you in this song to “imagine a world where we all could see the fundamental truths that set us free. No more dissonance, no more confusion. Just unity of insight, our shared conclusion.”

Imagine that world, will you?
