Regardless of where you stand on the political or religious spectrum, it's pretty easy to see that you don't agree with each and every person in the world on a number of issues. We simply differ in the ways we believe and how we understand our experiences."

            "I think this can also be answered easily, but the answer is perhaps somewhat less satisfying. I like to think about this from a logical perspective. In undergraduate, when I took a course on proofs in mathematics, one of the first things they taught us was how to determine whether a statement was true. It required a couple of elements: a set of assumptions, and the statement in question.",
            "The way in which the truth of the statement was determined was via a logical proof using statements which logically follow from each other until the desired outcome was achieved - either the statement is true or it is false. In other words, what I'm saying is that we cannot say with 100% certainty that any statement is true or false, because every statement depends on a set of assumptions which are, by definition, not proved, or perhaps even unprovable."

I claim that, under this assumption, complete alignment in all humans' world models is not only possible, but inevitable, and will happen as the intelligence explosion reaches its end."

And once we've hit this future, regardless of what it looks like, we will have a clear pathway to global peace, and it will happen at least by the time that humanity effectively knows everything there possibly is to know, if not much sooner than that.",
