## Consolidation Notes
These incremental versions were archived on 2025-08-01 to eliminate confusion while preserving the development history. The current active visualizations represent the most evolved thinking about the ecosystem architecture.

The progression shows a clear evolution from entertainment-focused (gaming) → economic integration (finance) → social impact focus (cooperative kingdom), with each iteration building on and expanding the previous concepts.

If you need to reference specific features from earlier iterations, they remain fully functional in this archive.
