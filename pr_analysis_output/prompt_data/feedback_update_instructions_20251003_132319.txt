      "merge_readiness": "ready",
      "reason": "This is a functional template file for blog post creation - not incomplete content",
      "detailed_feedback": "This is a properly structured template file for creating new blog posts. The placeholder content and empty asset fields are intentional design features that make it easy for content creators to start new posts.

        "File is ready for merge - functional template for blog post creation",
        "Template structure is appropriate for content creation workflow",
